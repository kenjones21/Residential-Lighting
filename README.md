# Residential-Lighting
A python app for estimating end use residential lighting electricity consumption, based on DOE data

# Introduction
Currently, most data for estimating energy usage is tucked away in spreadsheets and code, in accesible
but hard to find places. The purpose of this project is to create an intuitive API for retrieving and
working with this data.
